## Introduction

This design portfolio is a curated space to showcase my creative work to the public. The design theme revolves around a classic black and white color palette, accentuated with subtle hints of pastel pink. This choice reflects a balanced blend of elegance, minimalism, and a touch of warmthâ€”capturing my character as someone who values simplicity yet appreciates a soft, playful charm. The pastel pink adds a hint of personality, making the portfolio feel approachable and unique without overwhelming the viewer.
