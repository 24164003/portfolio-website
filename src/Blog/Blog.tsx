                                This is a professional headshot taken with a careful balance
                                of technical precision and aesthetic design. I selected an
                                ambiance and setting that complement my formal attire, ensuring
                                the overall tone aligns with the intended professional look.
                                This image was taken with an iPhone 13, using its high-quality
                                camera capabilities to create a clean, formal headshot suitable
                                for professional settings.
                                <hr />
                                Technical properties-
                                This image was captured using the wide camera setting at a focal
                                length of 26mm with an aperture of f/1.6. These settings improved
                                the brightness of the image while adding a blurred effect around
                                the subject which is ideal for professional headshot. To reduce
                                the effect of noise and to create a balance between sensitivity
                                and noise reduction ISO 250 was chosen during the photography session.
                                This image was shot at a faster shutter speed of 1/60s to avoid
                                motion blur and capture a photograph with ample lighting effects.
                                I was able to get a well-lit and crisp formal headshot with these
                                properties that will complement a professional setting. The neutral
                                and minimal colour palette of the outfit gave the image
                                the impression of professional grade photos.

                                Using photography to connect with nature has been incredibly personal and
                                enlightening for me. I can't help but want to capture pictures whenever I
                                go for a stroll in the outdoors. The nature photographs I capture of flowers,
                                beautiful mountains and serene lakes bring a profound sense of tranquility
                                within me. Every picture depicts a unique moment with the vivid hues of the
                                sky, the soft murmurs of the wind, the simplicity of a flower, and the
                                glazing movement of the water.
                                <hr />
                                This image of a beautiful landscape in the midst of a forest at the University
                                of Limerick was captured on a Google Pixel 7A with an ISO of 50 and an
                                aperture of f/2.2. The faster shutter speed of 1/697 helped the photograph
                                focus on the subject and slightly blur the background while showing the
                                beautiful wildflowers and lush greenery. The contrast of the hues of sky and
                                the blooming flowers were enhanced with the Ultra HD feature. When capturing
                                the moments of reflection, I usually favour the unedited, raw version that
                                the muted tones and natural lighting create. Despite their simple technical
                                design, these photos truly reflect my desire to portray not only landscapes
                                but also the spirit of peace and exploration in everyday life. For me,
                                photography is more than just a skill; it's about capturing an emotion,
                                a moment, and a connection to Mother Nature.

                                This is an aesthetic shot of me on a serene, quiet urban street
                                with my eyes closed and soft smile. The image was taken in a setting
                                with golden hour, enhancing the simplicity and neutrality of my outfit.
                                The natural light in the background adds warmth and brightness to the scene,
                                while focusing on me as the subject.

                                This photograph was taken in google pixel 7A with its vivid feature called
                                ultra HD mode which enhances the contrast and brightness of minute details
                                in both shadowed and bright spaces. This image is captured at F/1.9 aperture
                                which helps to focus on the subject by subtly blurring out the background.
                                The ISO 45 settings helped maintain the realistic look of the image by 
                                increasing sharpness and minimizing unwanted noise. The 1/578 shutter speed 
                                freezes any motion, adding clarity, especially in dynamic scenes. These 
                                settings helped in creating an image with portrait like quality enhancing
                                 the vibrance and clarity of the image.
